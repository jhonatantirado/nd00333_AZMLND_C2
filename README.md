# Project: Operationalizing Machine Learning

In this project, you will continue to work with the Bank Marketing dataset. You will use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. You will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline. In the end, you will demonstrate all of your work by creating a README file and a screencast video.
